TopDownMap
==========

small tutorial code for a top-down map in Pygame.

It's not much, but it has a very simple map editor, and it demonstrates a way to use spritesheets for animation.
Please email me with any questions or comments. Feel free to use any part of this code for any reason.
I'd love to hear from you if you do, though!
